from ghci, use solveExpression to simplify arithmetic and algebraic expressions from strings
from ghci, use solveEquation to solve arithmetic and algebraic equations from strings

future plans:
-------------
include all log and power equivalencies, add all the trigonometric functions, e, i, pi, factorial, and functions on complex numbers

systems of equations

combinatorics, derivatives, integrals, logic, higher maths

write an algebraic expression generator as a bfw, reusing the transformations, and adding a few generative (non-equivalent) transformations ([Seed] -> [Generator] -> (Expression, [Generator]))

set up QuickCheck

install snap framework
  - expose as a json / html api
    - solve expression (expression -> (expression, pathToSolution))
    - generate complex expression (expression, pathToSolution, solution, generators)
    - verify solution (expression -> solution)
