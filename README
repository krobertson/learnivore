run cabal install in this directory to install learnivore, 
  then execute with learnivore -p 8000
  then go to localhost:8000
  then input an equation
from ghci, :l Equations
  and use solveExpression to simplify arithmetic and algebraic expressions from strings
  and use solveEquation to solve arithmetic and algebraic equations from strings*

*For now, please make sure that = sign has no spaces around it (eg. 2 * x=5 * 2; NOT 2 * x = 5 * 2)

Current Functionality:
----------------------

Solves algebraic equations of one variable
Example:

Please enter an equation:
2^x=4
------------------
2.0^x = 4.0
=>
x = log<2.0>(4.0)
=>
x = 2.0
"=> Equation is True!"

future plans:
-------------
DRY the expression and equation transformations up

write an algebraic expression generator as a bfw, reusing the transformations, and adding a few generative (non-equivalent) transformations ([Seed] -> [Generator] -> (Expression, [Generator]))

set up QuickCheck for testing

include all log and power equivalencies, add all the trigonometric functions, e, i, pi, factorial, and functions on complex numbers

combinatorics, derivatives, integrals, logic, higher maths

systems of equations

Snap
  - expose as a json api
    - solve expression (expression -> (expression, pathToSolution))
    - generate complex expression (expression, pathToSolution, solution, generators)
    - verify solution (expression -> solution)
